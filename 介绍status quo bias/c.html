                        <p style="padding: 50px 0px;"> When individuals are faced with inconsistent thoughts, they experience cognitive dissonance; an uncomfortable feeling that most people wish to minimize. Sometimes, individuals will avoid thoughts that make them uncomfortable in
                            order to maintain cognitive consistency.</p>
                        <p>In decision-making, individuals tend to see an option as more valuable once they have chosen it. Even simply considering an alternative to the status quo can cause cognitive dissonance, as it puts the value of two potential options
                            in conflict with one another. As a result, individuals may stick with the status quo in order to reduce that dissonance.</p>
