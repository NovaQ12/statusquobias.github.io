                    <p>Status quo bias is a cognitive bias that explains our preference for familiarity. Many of us tend to resist change and prefer the current state of affairs. The phenomenon is most impactful in the realm of decision-making: when we make
                        decisions, we tend to prefer the more familiar choice over the less familiar, but potentially more beneficial, options.</p>
                    <p>Explanations for Status quo bias may include loss aversion, sunk costs, and cognitive dissonance. Click the links below for further information.</p>
                    <p>Of course, like many other cognitive biases, the status quo bias does have benefits. Because it prevents people from taking risks and offers a certain degree of protection. However, the status quo bias can have a negative impact on
                        your most significant life choices that might impact your finances, your jobs, and even your health. By being aware of how the status quo bias influences your decisions and behaviors, you can look for ways to reduce the bias in
                        the choices you make each and every day.</p>
