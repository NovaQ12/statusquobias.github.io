                        <p style="padding: 50px 0px;"> The sunk cost fallacy refers to the fact that an individual will often continue to invest resources (time, money, or effort) into a specific endeavor simply because they have already invested resources in that endeavor, even if
                            that endeavor has not proven beneficial. Sunk costs lead individuals to continue along a specific course of action, even if it is failing. Sunk costs contribute to status quo bias because the more that an individual invests
                            in the status quo, the more likely he or she is to continue to invest in the status quo.</p>
